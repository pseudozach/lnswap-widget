## Swap Provider's Guide

LNSwap is based on the open-source submarine/atomic swap app [lnstxbridge](https://github.com/pseudozach/lnstxbridge). This app is available for anyone to deploy on a VPS or any docker capable platform to independently serve trustless swaps.

Ready to deploy your own lnstxbridge instance? Jump into the guide to run your own instance, provide liquidity and earn swap fees:&#x20;
