## Dashboard

In order to help swap providers, help make it easier to run the bridge and increase visibility into the day to day operation there's now an [admin dashboard](https://github.com/pseudozach/lnstxbridge-dashboard) that shows signer funds, swaps and balance status.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that if you followed the install script or docker-compose methods, you already have an instance of dashboard running on your system.
{% endhint %}

This dashboard is also open source and deployable with 1-click.
